prelab exercies:
A) Shahsum of dict.txt is 5e9fd2bc62ddb90f02d80cfd875cd2a4e722ebbb  dict.txt
B) shasum value after replace small p with capital p : 3baf34b55ba02dfd5b5ae3d01ba5201c28db024e  dict.txt
C) 3baf34b55ba02dfd5b5ae3d01ba5201c28db024e
   5e9fd2bc62ddb90f02d80cfd875cd2a4e722ebbb
   0001001000000000000000000000000000000000
   on 2 places hash value matches on 4th index and 7th index
D) We can match files hashes while transfering the files from one place to another that is a really amazing characteristic.
E) Shasum value for the small txt file ae9635a45b0c47bd383891e0721c0287fc973919  small_dict..txt 
F) numbers of charaters are same in larger and smaller file we know that larger the hash greater the security so we can 
   even secure our smaller files which have even 1 word init.



Exercise 1
A) 1st column

The first letter d does the content is directory or file. On the screenshot above, Desktop, Documents, Downloads and lynis-1.3.8 are directories. If it - (minus sign) it means that the content is file. While if it equal with l (small L character), means the content is link file.

The next 9 character is about file permission. With the first 3 rwx characters are for Owner of the file, the second 3 characters are for Group owner of the file and the last 3 characters are for worldwide access to the file.

2nd column
This tells us about how many link to this file

3rd column
This tells us about who is the owner of the file/directory

4th column
This tells us about who the group owner of the file/directory
5th column
This tells us about the size of the file/directory in bytes unit. Except for directories, the size will always count as 4096 bytes

6th column
This tells us about the last time and date the file is modified

7th column
This tells us the filename or directory name


B) command shasum print the hash of the file and file name.
C)
